# CS-351 Computer Architecture
## Sonoma State University - Spring 2025 - Instructor: David Shreiner
Repository for CS-351 Projects

### Project 1: Compiler Optimization

Experimenting with using compiler optimizations to improve code performance.

### Project 2: Multi-threading and Amdahl's Law

Demonstrating speed-up potential with parallelization and exploring Amdahl's Law

### Project 3: Introduction to CUDA

This project generates a few images using CUDA, viable via web browser.

### Project 4: More CUDA Magic

This project demonstrates two CUDA implementations
 - One example where a GPU does not outperform a CPU, despite the parallel nature of the algorithm
 - One example of generating Mandelbrot and Julia Sets (MUCH faster than the CPU version)
