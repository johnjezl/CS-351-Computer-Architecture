## Triangle

This verion creates a simple triangle. It uses the angle to compute the location of each corner of the triangle.

## Disk

This creates a color filled 10-sided convex polygon.

## Star

Here's a simple 5-pointed star in a solid color.

## Spinny Star

Now, let's make it spin!

## Color Gradient Star

And then add some cool color gradients (red to blue)

## Pattern Rotating and Color Shifting Star

Let's rotate through a set of patterns as the star spins.  Every time it starts a new rotation, the star changes to a new pattern.  There are two new patterns here. We've added a greyscale pattern as well as a color changing pattern.  The color changing pattern uses the time "tick" *t* to compute a multiplier that changes the color gradient in sync with the rotation of the star.
